# Qt 5.9 LTS is kept as a versioned formula because it's an LTS release, under support
# until May 2020.
# See https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/35883
#
# Patches for Qt must be at the very least submitted to Qt's Gerrit codereview
# rather than their bug-report Jira. The latter is rarely reviewed by Qt.
